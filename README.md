# 🚀 Maverick Start Program — Engineering Pre-Assessment

Welcome to the **Maverick Start Program Pre-Assessment**, your first step into the world of Payd. This assessment is designed to evaluate how well you can understand user needs, translate them into usable software, and think beyond limits — the core of what it means to be a **Maverick at Payd**.

## 🧠 About This Assessment

You’ll be building a **demo banking platform**. This can be frontend-only, backend-only, or full-stack depending on your track. The project will be hosted on GitHub and submitted via a **pull request** to this repository.

The assessment will test your:

- Product thinking & creativity
- Understanding of web or backend technologies
- Problem-solving with constraints
- Clarity in delivery and documentation

Worth mentioning is that all details provided here are the basics. A major part of the assesment is understanding your thought process, your ability to think outside the box and build solutions - your ability to blend in as a maverick.
